+ debezium-hello

This is a trival example -- the absolute simplest I could come up with -- of
using Camel's Debezium support to read change records from a relational
database. All this example does is consume update, insert, and delete records
published by the database, and log them in textual form.  In practice, of
course, we'd want to process the records in some way.
